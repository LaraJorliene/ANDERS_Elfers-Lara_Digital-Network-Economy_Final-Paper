Introduction InkConnect 

InkConnect is a start-up founded to create an app for tattoo lovers and tattoo artists to match. Nowadays, it is not easy to find the perfect tattoo artist because there are so many different artists, with different specializations, price segments, quality and hygiene standards, and locations. Additionally, most tattoo artist only promote themselves on social media or have a website with some of their work pictures and contact data. It is very complicated for tattoo lovers to select the right tattoo artists via researching. Most of the time, tattoo artists get recommended by other people and then it is still problematic to find out, if the artist fit to the clients need. To solve all these problems, the app-idea InkConnect has been founded.  

The app should include advantages for both, the customers/tattoo lovers and for the tattoo artists who get promoted on the app. The customers can register in the app for free, select all different kinds of filters that are matching their needs, and they can see pre-selected tattoo artist profiles according to their filters. The customers are able to contact the tattoo artists via this app, book appointments, see the artists’ work, and also give and read customer feedback. The tattoo artists on the other hand pay us a monthly fee to get promoted on that app, we as a company proof the hygiene and quality standards before allowing the artists to create a profile on our page, and we interact as a middleperson between the clients and the artists. The artists biggest advantage would be that they do not need any other tools or platforms to make appointments, promote their art, catch customers, and work on the customer relation management.  

Video Creation 

In order to show the solution InkConnect provides for both, tattoo lovers and tattoo artists, the promotion video should clarify the problems InkConnect wants to solve. A young woman, student and covered in tattoos, wants to find a new tattoo artist for her new project. She searches different artists on Instagram but is not able to find the right one for her specific needs. InkConnect will be introduced as a solution with all the filter option and advantages and the woman can book her next tattoo appointment via the app. Before creating the video itself, a storyboard was created to plan the video and to integrate all the necessary information needed. This storyboard was the basis for filming the individual video clips which have then been edited in Adobe Premiere Pro 2022. Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing application published as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud licensing program. Adobe Premiere Pro, introduced in 2003, is the successor to Adobe Premiere (first launched in 1991). It is designed for professional video editing, whereas Adobe Premiere Elements is designed for consumers (Adobe, n.d.). 

After filming the separate clips according to the storyboard, they have been saved, renamed in the right order how they should be integrated in the timeline, and were integrated in the program. First a new project has been created and named and then the clips have been uploaded in the new project. Furthermore, color mats in black and white have been selected and a previously designed logo of InkConnect has been integrated, as well as silent background music to create a nice atmosphere. Then the separate clips were cut in the timeline, the little text pop ups were integrated, and the final video has been exported.

Reflection and Experience 

The most interesting part was to create the layout for the app, since it was the first time seeing the ideas becoming a visualization. Brainstorming ideas, creating a start-up and all features the future product should have is always fun and something that is very interesting. Additionally, creating a business idea that could be valuable for potential customers requires a customer analysis in advance, which also takes some time and research to fully understand the customer needs.  

Creating the video was also a nice experience. However, it was a little struggle to visualize the ideas into one video. I needed somebody who filmed me, which was quite challenging because many people were very busy during this time. Additionally, it was hard to visualize the app when only a previous layout was available and not a ready-to- use app that could have been presented. Therefore, I was quite unhappy with the quality of the layout recordings because I had to film my own laptop to show the layout of the app in a PowerPoint presentation.  

When it came to the editing, it was a completely new experience for me since I have never used a professional video editing platform before.  

Video editing is a time-consuming and challenging task traditionally performed by highly trained experts. In the most basic sense, video editing is time selection— selecting a series of clips that tell a story from raw, unedited footage, and then trimming each video down to its relevant part. As such, editors are performing two main tasks: the high-level task of deciding which content to show, and the low-level task of precisely placing cut points in a way that is not distracting to viewers. Luckily, my colleague is a professional video cutter and has the Adobe software. He helped me to integrate my videos in the timeline and showed me how to use the most important and quite basic tools of the software. It took more time than I thought because I experienced myself to be quite perfectionistic when it comes to creating nice transitions between the single clips. Finally, it was a proud moment to see the first self-cut video, even as I had to re- worked it a bit because it was longer than 3:20min. I think it is an advantage to know how to work with cutting software and to create visual content.
